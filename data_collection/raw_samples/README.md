Collect Raw Samples
===================

To collect raw samples:

```
$ #sudo ./collect_rawSamples.js <mac_address_with_colons>
$ sudo ./collect_rawSamples.js c0:98:e5:70:45:37
```

It will say "Finished! Disconnecting..." and may automatically exit when done.

The data will then be in rawSamples_num*.bin
